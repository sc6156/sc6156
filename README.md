    <p align="left">I'm Scott, a security professional eager to transition to a career in data science and AI having recently completed a MSc in Computer Science with Data Analytics. I 
      would love to develop model and tools which benefit the public sector, having worked in this area for several years. I explored this topic in my research project for my MSc by 
      fine-tuning transformer-based text summarisation models on a child protection dataset that I created from publicly available sources. If you would like to read my research, just 
      visit my <a href="https://github.com/sc6156/academic-work/tree/main"> academic-work repo</a>. This repo also contains other work I did during my MSc, as well as the 
      dissertation and two essays I wrote for a MA in Transnational Organised Crime that I obtained in 2017.</p>
