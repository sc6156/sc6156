## Hello there ðŸ‘‹

<img align="left" src="https://github.com/sc6156/sc6156/blob/main/profile.jpg" alt="profile_pic" width="200"/>

I'm Scott, a security professional eager to transition to a career in data science and AI having recently completed a MSc in Computer Science with Data Analytics. I would love to develop models and tools which benefit the public sector, having worked in this area for several years. I explored this topic in my research project for my MSc by fine-tuning transformer-based text summarisation models on a child protection dataset that I created from publicly available sources. If you would like to read my research, just visit my [academic-work repository](https://github.com/sc6156/academic-work/tree/main). This repository also contains other work I did during my MSc, as well as the dissertation and two essays I wrote for my MA in Transnational Organised Crime that I obtained in 2017.
