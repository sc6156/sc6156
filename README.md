    <p align="left">I'm Scott, a security professional eager to transition to a career in data science and AI having recently completed a MSc in Computer Science with Data Analytics. I 
      would love to develop models and tools which benefit the public sector, having worked in this area for several years. I explored this topic in my research project for my MSc by 
      fine-tuning transformer-based text summarisation models on a child protection dataset that I created from publicly available sources. If you would like to read my research, just 
      visit my <a href="https://github.com/sc6156/academic-work/tree/main"> academic-work repo</a>. This repo also contains other work I did during my MSc, as well as the 
      dissertation and two essays I wrote for a MA in Transnational Organised Crime that I obtained in 2017. I appreciate there is a lot of content in this repo, so I have listed many of the 
      languages and tools that I have used below, alongside some of the certifications and credentials that I hold.</p>

<p>I will be adding further repos as I work on personal projects to develop my knowedge of all things AI, so watch this space! In the meantime, please feel free to contact me if you have any questions about my work.</p>
